# Dev Session Canvas

Dev Session Canvas is a multi-agent AI workbench inside VS Code, and the canvas is its primary interaction surface. It lets you place `Agent`, `Terminal`, and `Note` nodes in the same view so you can manage multiple development execution sessions without bouncing between chat panels, terminal tabs, and editors. The extension is currently in public `Preview`.

## 0.19.0 Highlights

The public `0.19.0` release is a new Preview milestone for visual Agent input and multi-root workflow polish. It adds image paste for live `Agent` nodes, lets the sidebar add existing git worktrees to the current workspace, keeps multi-root session-history restore anchored to the original cwd, and fixes several high-output, file-link, Pane Gallery, and panel-edge details. It keeps all `0.18.2` release boundaries: Preview positioning, notifier auto-install, GitHub Release assets plus verified Open VSX as the current completion gate, and Visual Studio Marketplace as a deferred channel until public visibility is confirmed.

- Live `Agent` nodes can now paste clipboard images. Supported PNG, JPEG, and WebP payloads are saved to extension storage and inserted as a file-path reference without auto-submitting the prompt
- `Terminal` nodes ignore image-only paste instead of writing image paths or binary data into the shell; temporary Agent image-paste files are cleaned by a background TTL task
- The sidebar `Nodes` worktree flow can add an existing git worktree to the current workspace, and the global picker now collapses multiple folders from the same repository by git common directory
- Multi-root session-history restore and fork actions preserve the history item's original cwd so the new Agent resolves back to the intended workspace root
- Root-qualified file links such as `workspace-b/src/file.ts` now resolve inside the named workspace root instead of falling through to the active execution cwd or sibling roots
- Webview output draining is fairer across many active Agents, so later high-output nodes are not starved by the first few nodes in the queue
- Pane Gallery status hints, fit-view bounds, and active canvas panel padding were tightened without changing the extension ID, VS Code minimum version, notifier relationship, or support matrix

## Core Capabilities

- Open the main canvas in either the panel or the editor area
- Create `Agent`, `Terminal`, and `Note` nodes
- Drive `Agent` nodes through the `codex` or `claude` CLI
- Run `Terminal` nodes through the embedded terminal surface
- Let `Agent` and embedded `Terminal` nodes inherit a controlled shell environment, with diagnostics showing the current resolution path
- Paste supported screenshots directly into live `Agent` nodes as temporary image-file references while preserving manual prompt submission
- Create cwd-scoped `Terminal` or `Agent` nodes from workspace folders and files through File Explorer context menus
- Write contextual notes with Markdown syntax inside `Note` nodes
- Associate `Note` nodes with `.md` / `.markdown` files in the workspace, including YAML metadata popovers and safe Markdown image previews
- Use built-in and custom templates to restore reusable `Agent` / `Terminal` / `Note` work surfaces, including explicit save modes for associated Markdown Notes
- Organize related `Agent`, `Terminal`, and `Note` nodes with named canvas groups, nested group frames, group resize, and grouped sidebar browsing
- Fork a Codex or Claude Code Agent with a trusted session id into a new Agent node using provider-native fork semantics
- Compose VS Code multi-root workspaces into one canvas with system workspace-root sections while preserving each root's own canvas state
- Switch multi-root workspaces into an optional Pane Gallery with dynamic / grid overviews and top / side thumbnail modes
- Use fit view and the MiniMap across the full canvas space, including nodes, user groups, and workspace-root sections
- Arrange the canvas layout once from the context menu while preserving group and workspace-root boundaries
- Keep canvas browsing available in `Restricted Mode` while automatically disabling execution entry points
- Provide stronger persistence guarantees through `runtimePersistence.enabled` when `systemd --user` is available on Linux local or `Remote SSH`, and otherwise fall back automatically to `best-effort`
- View sidebar `Nodes` and `Session History` lists to jump to current canvas nodes and restore or fork a new `Agent` node from history
- Manage workspace folders and git worktrees from the sidebar `Nodes` view, including adding existing worktrees and explicit confirmations before removing folders or linked worktrees

## Best Fit

- Trusted workspaces on a standard filesystem
- Environments where `codex` or `claude` CLI is already installed
- Developers who want to observe multiple development sessions without switching constantly between terminal tabs
- Users who want a canvas-shaped AI workbench rather than a single chat panel

## Support Scope And Limits

- The `Remote SSH` main path is validated and usable, and it remains the best-validated recommended environment
- Linux and macOS local workspaces now have functional validation for the `Preview` main path
- Windows local workspaces now have functional validation for the `Preview` main path, with one explicit known limitation: when using `Codex`, embedded session history still cannot page upward
- The sidebar `Session History` list only shows records that can be explicitly attributed to the current workspace; older sessions without working-directory metadata are skipped conservatively
- `Restricted Mode` allows the canvas to open, but disables execution entry points such as `Agent` and `Terminal`
- `Virtual Workspace` is not supported yet
- The extension is still in `Preview`, with no stable-release commitment

## Environment Requirements

- VS Code `1.80.0` or later
- A standard filesystem workspace
- `Agent` nodes require `codex` or `claude` CLI to be reachable from the Extension Host
- `Terminal` nodes require a shell available on the workspace side

## Installation And Upgrades

- The extension ID is `devsessioncanvas.dev-session-canvas`
- First-time installs and upgrades from `0.18.2` to `0.19.0` should use the public extension registry configured by the current host. Open VSX should publish and verify the same version for compatible hosts and remains the current marketplace completion gate; the official VS Code `Visual Studio Marketplace` path is announced only after the release-day visibility check confirms both the main extension and notifier are public. If VSM remains deferred for this release, GitHub Release assets are the manual-install fallback
- Pane Gallery only changes multi-root presentation. Single-root workspaces keep the normal canvas, and `rootGroups` remains the default multi-root mode and conservative fallback
- Layout arrangement is an explicit one-shot action. It does not offer undo, run continuously, or move nodes across ordinary groups or workspace roots
- If you previously set `devSessionCanvas.notifications.attentionSignalBridge`, `devSessionCanvas.notifications.enabledAttentionSignals`, `devSessionCanvas.notifications.strongTerminalAttentionReminder`, `devSessionCanvas.notifications.agentAbnormalOutputTextNotifications`, `devSessionCanvas.canvas.linkOpenMode`, `devSessionCanvas.canvas.workspaceRootWatermarks.enabled`, or `devSessionCanvas.canvas.multiRootPresentationMode`, upgrading to `0.19.0` preserves that explicit choice
- Image paste files are temporary extension-storage attachments, not workspace files. They are retained long enough for Agent context reuse and then cleaned by the background TTL maintenance task
- If your `0.2.0` workspace kept an older view-layout cache, the sidebar `Overview` and `Common Actions` views may appear as two separate icons for a while. That does not mean two extensions are installed. Move both views back into the same `Dev Session Canvas` container, or run `View: Reset View Locations`
- During Preview, cross-version workspace-state compatibility is not guaranteed. If a workspace contains important canvas state, back it up or validate in a non-critical environment before upgrading


## Desktop Notification Companion (Auto-Installed)

- Installing `Dev Session Canvas` automatically installs `Dev Session Canvas Notifier` (`devsessioncanvas.dev-session-canvas-notifier`)
- If a user installs from the notifier page first, VS Code also auto-installs the main extension `Dev Session Canvas`
- Execution-node attention signals now prefer the local desktop by default through `devSessionCanvas.notifications.attentionSignalBridge = system`; switch the setting if you want `workbench` or `none`, or narrow attention sources with `devSessionCanvas.notifications.enabledAttentionSignals`
- In `system` mode, the main extension prefers the local UI-side companion and falls back to VS Code workbench notifications when the companion is missing, unsupported, or delivery fails
- The companion is especially useful in `Remote SSH`, WSL, and Dev Container scenarios where the main extension runs on the workspace side but the notification needs to return to the local desktop


## Usage Tips

### Unable to Create Terminal and Agent Nodes on Windows

**Symptom**: The workspace is trusted, but creating a node still shows only `Note`; `Terminal` and `Agent` node types are unexpectedly missing.

**Troubleshooting**: If this still happens in a trusted workspace, check the Windows PowerShell execution policy first. In some environments, the execution policy may interfere with Node.js-related commands.

**Suggested Fix**:

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
2. Run the following command to set execution policy to `RemoteSigned`:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
   ```
3. Type `Y` to confirm the change
4. Close and reopen VS Code
5. Try creating a `Terminal` or `Agent` node again to confirm whether the issue is resolved

## Rollback Guidance

- If the current version blocks your workflow, disable or uninstall the extension first
- Prefer waiting for a later `0.19.x` fix release rather than trying to downgrade manually
- If you must roll back, reinstall the target version and verify workspace state again. Compatibility between Preview versions is not guaranteed
